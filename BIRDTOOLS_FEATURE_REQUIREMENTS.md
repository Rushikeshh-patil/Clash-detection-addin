# ADDIN Feature Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the feature requirements needed to mimic the BIRDTools clash preventor tool for a Revit add-in.

## Features

1. **Clash Detection**  
   - Ability to identify clashes between elements in a Revit model.  
   - Support for 2D and 3D visualizations of clashes.  

2. **User Interface**  
   - Intuitive user interface for ease of use.  
   - Options for filtering clash results based on categories, types, or their severity.  

3. **Clash Reporting**  
   - Generate detailed reports of detected clashes, including:  
     - List of all clashes  
     - Location of clashes within the model  
     - Suggested solutions or mitigation steps  

4. **Customization Options**  
   - Allow users to configure clash detection parameters according to project needs.  
   - Customize visual feedback for detected clashes (e.g., color coding).  

5. **Integration**  
   - Seamless integration with Revit for real-time clash detection.  
   - Support for importing/exporting clash results in various formats (e.g., CSV, Excel).  

6. **Performance Metrics**  
   - Ability to track performance metrics and detection times for optimization.  

7. **User Support**  
   - Comprehensive user guide and documentation.  
   - In-app support and tutorial options to assist users during the process.

## Conclusion  
Developing these features will ensure that the Revit add-in closely mimics the functionality of the BIRDTools clash preventor tool, providing users with a robust solution for clash detection and resolution in their projects.
